Hey, I’m Mélissa — Technical Artist focused on real-time environments, procedural systems, and production-ready solutions.

{: .note }
Great visuals are nothing without scalable systems behind them.

I specialize in bridging art and technology inside Unreal Engine, building procedural workflows, optimizing performance, and transforming creative ideas into robust real-time implementations.

My core interests revolve around environment development and PCG (Procedural Content Generation). I enjoy designing systems that empower artists — from building material setups in Shader Graph to creating Blueprint-driven tools that streamline production.

I’m particularly drawn to R&D work: exploring new techniques, testing performance boundaries, and implementing emerging technologies in real-world pipelines. In AAA production environments, I’ve contributed to the integration of advanced solutions such as FluidFlux, ensuring both visual fidelity and runtime efficiency.

Performance matters. Scalability matters. Clean workflows matter.

I enjoy solving complex rendering and optimization challenges — whether that means reducing overdraw, improving memory usage, refining shader logic, or helping teams understand technical constraints without compromising artistic intent.

Documentation is a core part of my process. Clear documentation turns individual knowledge into shared team strength. I believe that strong tech art is not just about building systems — it's about making them understandable, maintainable, and production-proof.

Curiosity drives my research. Production constraints sharpen my solutions.  
And every technical challenge is an opportunity to build something smarter.

Gaming has shaped my career since I was eight, discovering Final Fantasy IX and realizing I wanted to build worlds like that.  
As a retro gamer turned hardcore MMO player, I was drawn to complex PvE mechanics and large-scale PvP strategies.  
I’ve always analyzed systems, performance constraints, and how mechanics hold together behind the scenes.  
Today, that mindset drives my work as a Technical Artist — building procedural environments, optimizing real-time systems, and bridging art with technology.  
I don’t just play games — I study, deconstruct, and engineer them.


When I’m not building systems or exploring game worlds, I focus on bringing developers together. I organize community-driven events in Québec City, such as DevTeamDrink, creating spaces where game devs can connect beyond the studio walls.  

Over the years, I’ve also been a streamer, a dedicated cosplayer, and a proudly gothic creative spirit — always drawn to immersive worlds and expressive storytelling.  

I play Dungeons & Dragons, and my version of paradise is live-action roleplay — especially events like Bicolline — where imagination, community, and world-building collide in real life.

## The Mind Behind the Keyboard

This blog is where I document my journey as a Technical Artist — sharing breakdowns, production insights, and tutorials to make complex topics more accessible. I believe knowledge grows stronger when it’s shared.  
Transitioning from artist to a more technical profile isn’t impossible — and I want to show that evolution openly, with its challenges and breakthroughs.  
I also care deeply about visibility. Women have a place in tech, in rendering, in pipelines, in R&D — and we don’t have to shrink ourselves to fit in.  
Beyond my own work, I aim to highlight the stories of the people I meet along the way — developers, artists, thinkers — whose paths deserve to be heard.

Looking back, every step — from being an environment artist to implementing real-time systems in AAA production — shaped the Technical Artist I am today. Each challenge pushed me to think deeper about workflows, scalability, and performance.

Curiosity still drives me. Whether I’m exploring procedural generation, refining shader logic, or researching new optimization techniques, I’m constantly learning. In tech art, there is no final level — only better questions to ask.

{: .important }
If a task repeats, it should become a tool. If a system scales, it should be documented.

Thank you for being part of this journey. This space is about sharing research, production insights, and the mindset behind building smarter systems. Whether you’re an artist moving toward tech, a developer curious about real-time workflows, or someone navigating your own evolution, I’m glad you’re here.
